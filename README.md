# Bouncing Balls
Bouncing Balls is a tutorial game that demonstrates use of physics engine of
Cocos.

It will also develop a game development strategy to enable extensive reuse of
components and code patterns in future games.

## Development

### Troubleshooting

#### Changes not reflected in running game
-- Check Developer Console -> Network -> Disable Cache
-- Check Developer Console -> Settings -> Disable Cache
-- Check not more than one Cocos process running - each process runs on a
different port number




TODO:

Single-instance restart button is causing probs in GameOverLayer as the restart
was created from scratch each time the menu loaded before.
